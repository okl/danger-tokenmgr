# danger-tokenmgr

This is an application designed to manage token replacement for
configuration files. This project uses zookeeper as a
backend. There's a compojure app designed for managing the values of
the tokens, and a command line driver for performing the replacement.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed. You also need
to have [zookeeper][2] installed, configured, and running.

[2]: http://zookeeper.apache.org

## Running

<<<<<<< HEAD
First, create conf/tokenmgr.yml (see conf/tokenmgr.yml.sample) as
appropriate for your environment.

Next you must properly initialize the SlickGrid submodule. In the top-level directory, run:
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
=======
First, edit zookeeper_storage.clj to match the zookeeper url to the
correct one for your environment.

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

This allows you to run the UI and manage tokens and values.

To run the command line replacement dirver run:

    lein run <application-name> <environment> <directory to filter [--token "TOKEN_NAME=TOKEN_VALUE"]
