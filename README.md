# danger-tokenmgr

This is an application designed to manage token replacement for
configuration files. This project uses zookeeper as a
backend. There's a compojure app designed for managing the values of
the tokens, and a command line driver for performing the replacement.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed.

You also need to have [zookeeper][2] installed, configured, and
running. Alternatively, you can set up a [vagrant][3] instance using
the box at s3://okl-danger/zookeeper/zookeeper.box (tar zxf it into
~/.vagrant.d/boxes/) and the Vagrantfile at
s3://okl-dnager/zookeeper/Vagrantfile (put it in ~, then run 'vagrant up').

## Running

First, create conf/tokenmgr.yml (see conf/tokenmgr.yml.sample) as
appropriate for your environment. If you're running the vagrant vm,
this is a no-op.

Next, you must properly initialize the SlickGrid submodule. In the top-level directory, run:
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

This allows you to run the UI and manage tokens and values.

To run the command line replacement dirver run:

    lein run <application-name> <environment> <directory to filter [--token "TOKEN_NAME=TOKEN_VALUE"]
